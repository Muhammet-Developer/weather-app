# weather-app
I made a weather app. First of all, to capture the weather live, I reached the openweathermap page and created my own API from there and pulled the data from there.
1. If my application wants to enter the same city name again, a warning is given.
2. There is a maximum of 4 cities to enter.
3. Empty data not allowed
3. The back pictures of the cards showing the weather conditions change at certain times of the day.
